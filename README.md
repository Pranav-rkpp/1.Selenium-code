# Selenium-code
# Vision
My moto is to replicate this repository into corporate standard. Multinational companies have a format where employees prepare a reverse KT (knowledge Transfer) document to pass their learning. The same way I tried to put the things together. 

# Version: 
1. Selenium 3.141.59
2. java version "17.0.7" 2023-04-18 LTS                                                               
   Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 17.0.7+8-LTS-224)                                                        
   Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.7+8-LTS-224, mixed mode, sharing)  

# Introduction:

This whole repository contains the concept of selenium concepts with corresponding code.

Before diving into code, we need minimum knowledge about the concepts theoretically. So that I have prepared a single document which consist all sort of concepts. This document acts as a brush up tool. With the help of this doc file, we will surely understand the vision of preparing this repository.

#Note: I have mentioned the file name along with path. @1.Selenium-code/Selenium.docx
